Below is a high-level summary of the TCP-like state machine in tubes/reliable.go
and a proposed test matrix to cover its core transitions and edge cases.

## 1. State‑Machine Summary

### 1.1 State definitions

The tube’s connection states (modeled after TCP) are declared here:

    const (
        created   state = iota
        initiated state = iota

        // These states are pulled from the TCP state machine.
        closeWait state = iota
        lastAck   state = iota
        finWait1  state = iota
        finWait2  state = iota
        closing   state = iota
        closed    state = iota
    )
【F:tubes/reliable.go†L22-L32】

### 1.2 “Three‑way” handshake (INIT)

When a peer receives an INITIATE frame in the created state, it moves to initiated:

    if r.tubeState == created {
        r.recvWindow.m.Lock()
        r.recvWindow.ackNo = 1
        r.recvWindow.m.Unlock()
        r.log.Debug("INITIATED!")
        r.tubeState = initiated
        r.sender.recvAck(1)
        close(r.initRecv)
    }
【F:tubes/reliable.go†L411-L419】

### 1.3 Active close (local Close → FIN exchange)

Close() in state initiated transitions to finWait1 and sends a FIN; an ACK of that FIN moves to finWait2, and finally to closed.
【F:tubes/reliable.go†L518-L526】【F:tubes/reliable.go†L324-L335】

### 1.4 Passive close (remote FIN → local Close)

Receiving a FIN in various states drives transitions through closeWait, closing, lastAck, and closed.
【F:tubes/reliable.go†L339-L352】【F:tubes/reliable.go†L521-L524】

### 1.5 Final cleanup → closed

Both handshake and timer paths converge on enterClosedState():
【F:tubes/reliable.go†L378-L394】

## 2. Proposed Test Matrix

Below is a list of table-driven tests to cover all core transitions, errors, and timeouts.

### 2.1 Handshake (INIT) tests

| Scenario                       | Client state flow      | Server state flow      | Expected outcome                |
|--------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Simple three-way handshake     | created → initiated    | created → initiated    | Both sides unblocked on init    |
| Retransmit INIT on timeout     | Retries until response | Reply only once       | Client enters initiated        |
| Duplicate INIT request         | Retries before resp    | Ignores duplicate      | No deadlock or duplicate ack   |

### 2.2 Data-transfer tests

| Scenario                    | Condition                          | Expected behavior                         |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Basic write/read            | client.Write → server.Read         | Full payload delivered in order            |
| Windowing                   | >128 frames without ACK            | Sender blocks then resumes on ACK          |
| Out-of-order → RTR          | Deliver frame n+1 before n         | Receiver requests retransmission (RTR)     |
| Cancel RTR if in-order      | Missing frame arrives before wait  | RTR request canceled                       |
| RTO retransmission          | Drop ACK, wait > RTO               | Sender retransmits via RTO path            |

### 2.3 Termination (CLOSE) tests

| Scenario                                | Initiator state flow                 | Responder state flow                   |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Active close                            | initiated → finWait1 → finWait2 → closed  | initiated → closeWait → lastAck → closed |
| Simultaneous close                      | Both: initiated → finWait1            | Both: handle peer FIN similarly        |
| Missing FIN-ACK → lastAck timeout       | closeWait → lastAck → closed (timer)   | —                                      |
| Read after close                        | Read() → io.EOF                       | Read() → io.EOF                         |
| Write after close                       | Write() → io.EOF                      | Write() → io.EOF                        |
| Close before init                       | Close() on created → ErrBadTubeState  | —                                      |
| Double Close                            | Two Close() calls → second returns io.EOF|

### 2.4 Error-state tests

| Scenario                        | Operation           | Expected error        |
|---------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Read before init                | Read() on created   | ErrBadTubeState       |
| Write before init               | Write() on created  | ErrBadTubeState       |
| Receive after closed            | Inject frame post-closed | ErrBadTubeState  |

### 2.5 Miscellaneous tests

| Scenario                        | Focus                | Expected behavior                       |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Priority-queue ordering         | ACK/RTR vs data      | ACK/RTR have priority                    |
| CreateChannel/Accept race       | Concurrent calls     | No deadlock; one channel per side        |
| Deadline behavior               | Set deadlines        | Operations past deadline error           |
| Unreliable tubes smoke tests    | UDP-like semantics   | Packet drops and reordering             |

This test matrix should fully exercise the TCP-like state transitions in the tubes package,
as well as its error and timeout behaviors.

\section{Protocol Overview}

Rather than using separate chains for the
protocol transcript and key derivation, SSTP incorporates duplex objects to
reduce the state machine to a single chain and authenticates the whole
transcript with tags derived from the duplex material at each step of the
handshake.

Design features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Roaming Support: Crypto Session remains alive even with roaming
    \item No state needs to be kept on the server before clients are
    authenticated. This helps prevent denial-of-service attacks.
    In discoverable server mode, the server still has to perform work for every
    Client Hello, but never has to keep state.
    \item Simple (symmetric actions for both client and server during handshake)
    \item first class support for Identity Forwarding
\end{itemize}

Generic Goals of a cryptographic tunne; handshake:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Authenticate both parties
    \item obtain a shared secret with identity of both parties embedded in it
    \item forward secrecy: have ephemeral contribution in shared secret
\end{itemize}

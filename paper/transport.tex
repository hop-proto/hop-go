\section{Transport Protocol}

\subsection{Discoverable Server}
To establish a cryptographic session between a client and a discoverable server,
we base the cryptographic handshake on the Noise XX handshake
pattern~\cite{noise}. 

Initially, both the client and server are unauthenticated. The client begins by
creating a client ephemeral key pair ($e_c^{priv}, e_c^{pub}$) and chooses the
protocol name (or version?). The message type (client hello), protocol, and the
client ephemeral public key are absorbed into the duplex object, and a message
authentication code (MAC) is squeezed out. The client then begins the
session handshake by sending the Client Hello, which contains (i) the message type,
(ii) the protocol version, (iii) a client ephemeral public key
($e_c^{pub}$), and (iv) the MAC.

If the Client Hello is successful, the server..

\subsection{Channel Multiplexing}

SSTP supports multiple channels within a single encrypted session. It borrows
and simplifies aspects of QUIC streams and TCP to implement a reliable stream
abstraction, but provides the option for unreliable data delivery within a
channel as well.

We show the format of an SSTP transport message in
Figure~\ref{fig:transport_message}. Channel multiplexing is implemented by
encapsulating a single \emph{channel frame} (green) within the Encrypted Data segment of
the transport message. Each channel is identified by the Channel ID in the
channel frame header. We borrow upon QUIC streams and statically allocate
even-numbered channel IDs for client-initiated channels and odd IDs for
server-initiated channels to avoid collisions during the channel creation process.
% note: QUIC actually does odd for client, even for server. 
Channel creation is performed through a 2-way handshake when either the client
or server sends a Channel Initiation Request and the other party successfully
replies with a Channel Initiation Response. Channels are closed when both
parties send and receive a frame with the \texttt{FIN} bit set to one. Multiple channels can be created and closed
repeatedly without tearing down the entire SSTP session.

\input{bytefields/transport_message.tex}

\subsection{Authentication and Encryption}
After the initial SSTP handshake messages, the payload (Encrypted Data) segment
of all SSTP transport messages are authenticated and encrypted. \todo{Wilson: more details}

\subsection{Channel Initiation}

Channel creation begins when one party (the initiator) sends a message with the
Frame Number set to 0. This initial message is the Channel Initiation Request,
and contains non-negotiable information determined by the initiator. This
includes the Channel ID and the Channel Type (reliable or unreliable), which
will be shared by both parties, as well as the initiator's Maximum Frame Size
and Window Size. If any of these values need to change during the lifetime of
the channel, the channel is closed and a new one is created. Additionally, any
initial data for the channel can be sent in the Data field.

Upon receipt of a Channel Initiation Request, the other party (the responder)
replies with a Channel Initiation Response. Channel Initiation Responses also
have the Frame Number set to 0, except it will also have the \texttt{ACC}
(ACCEPT) bit set to 1 if the responder agrees to create the channel, or 0 if the
responder rejects the channel creation. The initiatior distinguishes between new
Channel Initiation Responses and new Channel Initiation Requests from the
responder by checking if the Channel ID matches any outstanding requests. 

After both request and response frames have been received, the channel has been
created from the perspective of both the initiator and the responder. SSTP only
requires a 2-way handshake because all initial Frame Numbers start at 0.
Spoofing attacks caused by non-random initial sequence numbers are prevented
since the entire frame is encrypted within the transport message.

Channel creation handshake messages do not make use of the Acknowledgment Number
field. If the initiator does not receive a Channel Initiation Response for some
period of time after sending a request, it will assume that the Channel was not
created and either the request was lost or the response was lost. In either
case, it will retransmit a request. If the response was lost, the responder may
already be sending channel data since it assumes the channel has been created.
In this case, the initiator ignores all channel data until it properly receives
a Channel Initiation Response for the channel. If the responder receives a
duplicate request, the newer request takes precedence and all state from the
previous half-channel is destroyed.
%Unlike QUIC, 
We require that channel creation be explicit with the \texttt{REQ} bit set
to one. If a duplicate channel initiation request with an existing channel ID is
received, the new channel takes precedence and all state associated with the old
channel is dropped.


An SSTP transport message (for data) is composed of a SessionID, a Counter, Encrypted Data,
and MAC. We encapsulate channel \emph{frames} within the Encrypted Data section
of the transport message, providing authentication and encryption by default for all
packets (Figure~\ref{fig:channel_encapsulation}). For simplicitly, only one
frame is contained in an SSTP message, although future extensions may allow
multiple frames.

% All SSTP channel frames are one of four types: 
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Channel Initiation Request Frame
%     \item Channel Initiation Response Frame
%     \item Channel Data Frame
%     \item Channel Control Frame
% \end{itemize}
% Once an encrypted SSTP session has been established, either the client or the
% server can request to initiate a shared channel. A channel
% handshake is performed to establish the channel and mode (reliable or unreliable). In the absence of the loss
% of a handshake message, channel initiation handshakes will complete in a single
% round trip. We do not need a TCP-like 3-way handshake
% because initial sequence numbers (frame counters) for both direcitons of
% communication start at 0. Each channel is identified by a unique channel ID, so
% there is no confusion between separate channels, and spoofing attacks from
% non-random sequence numbers are already prevented from the encrypted transport
% protocol. We show the channel handshake as well as the tear-down sequence in Figure~\ref{fig:channel_protocol}.

% \vspace{5pt} \noindent \textit{Channel Initiation Request:}\quad
% The first message from the initiator to the
% responder contains a Channel Initiation Request Frame. We show the structure of
% the Channel Initiation Request Frame below.

% \input{bytefields/initiate_request_frame.tex}

% The frame header consists of the Channel ID and the Type. The initiator of the
% channel chooses whether the channel mode will be unreliable (0x0) or reliable (0x1).
% The maximum frame size the initiator is willing to receive as well as the
% initiator's initial window size are established in this first message.
% Initiation request frames also denote the
% \emph{Action} that will be performed across the channel (e.g., file transfer,
% remote shell, network proxy). Action labels will be a value agreed upon by both
% the client and the server (or standardized ahead of time), and initial action
% data can optionally be sent as well.

% \vspace{5pt} \noindent \textit{Channel Initiation Response:}\quad 
% After receiving and processing a channel initiation request, the responder replies with a
% Channel Initiation Response by echoing the channel ID and either sending a
% \texttt{REJECT} (0x0) or \texttt{ACCEPT} (0x1) in the response field. We show
% the structure of the Initiation Response Frame below.

% \input{bytefields/initiate_response_frame.tex}

% If the responder chooses to accept the channel, it also must send a Maximum
% Frame Size and Initial Window Size, and echo the Action Label requested by the
% initiatior. The responder may also respond with initial action data.

% \vspace{5pt} \noindent \textit{Data:}\quad 
% After the channel handshake completes, an encrypted channel is established
% between the client and server. At this point, either party can begin sending
% data packets, in the form of a Channel Data Frame. Again, the frame
% header consists of the channel ID for use in channel multiplexing as well as the
% frame type (data). For reliable channels, each data frame comes with a Frame
% Counter (effectively a sequence number with ISN = 0) and a maximum
% acknowledgement delay before retransmission occurs. We discuss loss recovery and
% packet reordering in Section~\ref{sec:reliable_channels}. For unreliable channels,
% these fields are ignored. The remaining Action Data Size and Action Data contain
% the payload. The Data Frame structure is shown below.

% \input{bytefields/data_frame.tex}

% \vspace{5pt} \noindent \textit{Control:}\quad
% SSTP uses control frames primarily for managing loss recovery and reordering for
% reliable channels, but also uses control frames with control type \texttt{END}
% for either party to indicate that it wishes to end the channel. The encrypted
% transport session remains even if all channels end. To end a channel, the
% initiator of the channel end request sends a control frame with control type set
% to \texttt{END}. The responder can reply with another \texttt{END} frame to
% completely end the channel. Once both sides have received and acknowledged
% \texttt{END} control frames (similar to TCP connection closing), the channel
% ends. We describe other control frame types in Section~\ref{sec:reliable_channels}.The Control Frame structure below.
